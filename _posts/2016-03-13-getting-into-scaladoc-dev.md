title: "Getting into Scaladoc Development"
---

Over the past months I've been working on the new Scaladoc - and it's coming
along nicely. Together with
[@heathercmiller](http://twitter.com/heathercmiller) and
[@vladureche](http://twitter.com/vladureche) we've overhauled the overall look
of Scaladoc as well as adding a bunch of useful features - like global member
search!

There are a lot more things we want done - and we'd love help! This post serves
as an intro to developing Scaladoc. If that piques your interest - read on.

## Scaladoc for 2.12.x ##
The new major version of Scala is scheduled for later this year, and currently
its doc tool generates sites like this one:

The new search functionality allows you to not only look for so called
"top-level entities" (`class`, `trait`, `object` and `package`) but members like
methods and even `val` and `var`s. The new search is not at all taxing, on a
big library like the collections - the results are shown almost
instantaneously. Nevertheless, we've got a progress bar showing you something's
actually happening:

## How does Scaladoc work? ##
The scaladoc tool is quite easy to understand - there are basically three things
that happen once you've specified what you want documented:

1. Scaladoc compiles the sources using the first step of the compiler (the
   frontend). This will fill a tree structure known as `Universe` with all the
   information about the sources (classes, members, variables etc). **See:**
   [DocFactory.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/DocFactory.scala)

2. Copy all needed assets to out location (i.e. scripts and CSS-files)

3. Traverse the `Universe` tree and for each top-level entity create an
   HTML-page using the `Entity` class. **See:**
   [Entity.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Entity.scala)

The bulk of this is done by the `HtmlFactory` class in [HtmlFactory.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/HtmlFactory.scala).

## How do I generate the docs? ##

Simple:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:scala/scala.git && cd scala
$ ant docs # "ant docs.lib" if you just want the standard library
```

## Where to begin ##

The markup of the entity page is defined in
[Entity.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Entity.scala).
If you're looking the change the HTML that's where you will want to look first.

If you want to add some static asset, remember that `HtmlFactory` needs to copy
it to the destination. So be sure to add your new resource to `libResources` in
[HtmlFactory.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/HtmlFactory.scala).

All the current static assets are located in the
[lib](https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/2.12.x/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib) directory.
That's where you'd want to put new things (it is also where `index.js` etc live!)

**How can I see my changes?** You have two options, if you changed the markup -
you'll need to regenerate the docs:

```bash
$ ant docs.clean && ant docs
```

When the changes are to scripts or style sheets I use a small `Makefile`:

```
all:
    cp src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/{index.css,index.js} build/scaladoc/library/lib/
```

Regenerating the docs all the time is a pain - if you just want to generate
them for a single file, do this:

```bash
$ ant quick.bin
$ build/quick/bin/scaladoc path/to/source/File.scala
```

## Where to really begin ##

There's still a lot of things to do before this can be considered release ready.
Here's a laundry list of things we need to do:

* General
    - Async all the things! We should be able to parallelize the generation of
      the doc pages
    - CSS cleanup! There are a lot of things not necessary anymore, these could
      simply be deleted
* Mobile, the docs look decent on mobile - but there's still a ton to do!
    - Landscape kills some of our layout
    - There is no good package overview (list on the right) - ideas welcome!
* Desktop
    - Keyboard navigation on entity pages (i.e. between members)
    - Better keyboard navigation on search results
    - Minor layout issues
    - Showing existence of companion `class`/`trait`/`object` (maybe *"You
      won't believe who* `Companion object Boolean` *went home with
      tonight!"*)

The full list of ideas and things to do can be found on
[scala-dev](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/84). Comment on the issue or reach out
to one of us on the [scala/contributors gitter](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors)
